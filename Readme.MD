Reflective section answer
Question 1:
the script first checks if the user asked for help  
then it looks at the options like -n or -v or both  
after that it expects the search word and the file name  
if it something is missing it shows an error and stops

Question 2:
if i wanted to support more options like regex or -i or -c or -l  
i will maybe use getopts to make it easier to read
then depending on the option or counting will change

Question 3:
the hardest part was making -v and -n work together, and the missing argument part, but i have managed to solve it thanks !
